This is the development repo for an R package intended to calculate degree day accumulations from weather station data. Degree days (DD) can be calculated in a variety of different ways, but most packages available do it based on daily averages. When you need more precision but only have daily maximum/minimum temperatures, as is often reported, you need to use one of the many models available to estimate your temperature function. 


I have named this package after my late cat, Dede Bahlai-Gerrath (1997-2011). She was a very good cat. We'll see if this name sticks/withstands peer review. It's a pun on DD / homage to [R for cats](http://rforcats.net/)
